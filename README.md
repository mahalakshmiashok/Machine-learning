# Online news popularity
 In this information era, reading and sharing news have become the center of people’s entertainment lives.
 I intend to make use of a largely and recently collected dataset with over 39644 articles from Mashable website
Some prediction approaches are based on analysing early users’ comments, or features about post contents and domains.  
Another proposed method predicted the article’s popularity not only based on its own appeal,
but also other articles that it is competing with. Prediction models with SVM, logistic regression, 
KNN are used along with advanced algorithms such as Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting. 
This project however, incorporates a broader and more abstracter set of features, 
and starts with basic regression and classification models to advanced ones, with elaborations about 
eﬀective feature selection through Boruta algorithm.
